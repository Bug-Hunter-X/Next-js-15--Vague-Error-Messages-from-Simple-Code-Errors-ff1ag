# Next.js 15: Vague Error Messages from Simple Code Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet tricky issue in Next.js 15: vague error messages arising from seemingly simple errors in the main application component.  Often, a subtle typo or syntax error results in a cryptic error message, making debugging a significant challenge.

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal Next.js application.  Observe how seemingly minor errors in this file cause unpredictable behavior during the development workflow.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates strategies to mitigate this challenge.  This includes careful code review, using a good linter, and employing techniques like console logging to isolate the source of the problem.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Introduce a simple syntax error (e.g., missing bracket or semicolon) into the `pages/index.js` file. 
4. Observe the Next.js error messages.  Note how hard it is to pinpoint the root cause.

## Solution:

The provided `bugSolution.js` highlights a more robust approach, suggesting ways to prevent and debug such errors.  This includes:

* **Linters:** Using ESLint or similar linters to catch many errors automatically.
* **Careful Code Review:**  Thorough code review helps identify minor errors missed by automated tools.
* **Console Logging:**  Strategic placement of `console.log` statements enables tracing the application's behavior and helps narrow down issues.
* **Debugging Tools:** Effective use of your IDE's debugging tools is important for inspecting variables and stepping through the code during runtime.
