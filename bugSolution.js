```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  // Added console log for debugging purposes
  console.log('Rendering Home component');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Improved Debugging Strategy:**

1. **Use a Linter:** Integrate ESLint or a similar linter into your development workflow.  This will catch many common syntax errors and style issues before they become runtime problems.
2. **Console Logging:**  Use `console.log` to trace variable values and the execution flow of your application. This helps isolate problems to the specific area of your code.
3. **Debugging Tools:** Utilize your IDE's debugging tools effectively. Set breakpoints to pause execution and inspect variables' values at various points in your code.  This enables a more systematic and efficient debugging process.
4. **Error Handling:** Consider implementing more robust error handling within your application. Use `try...catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions gracefully and provide better error messages to the user.
